# Morning Updates Summary
**Date:** October 30, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Photo Upload with Supabase
**Status:** Complete ‚úì

**What was done:**
- Created SQL script: [fix-photo-upload.sql](fix-photo-upload.sql)
- Added `photo` column to users table
- Created/verified `profile-photos` storage bucket (public)
- Set up RLS policies for secure photo uploads
- Users can now upload, update, and delete their own photos
- Public viewing of all profile photos enabled

**How to use:**
1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Users can upload photos in Settings ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Upload Photo
3. Photos are compressed to 400x400 (LinkedIn-style)
4. Photos are stored in: `profile-photos/{user_auth_id}/profile.jpg`

### 2. Display Photos Throughout the App
**Status:** Complete ‚úì

**Updated components:**
- ‚úÖ **Sidebar** ([Sidebar.jsx:162-174](Sidebar.jsx#L162-L174))
  - Shows user's photo in bottom profile section
  - Falls back to initials if no photo

- ‚úÖ **Dashboard** ([Dashboard.jsx:558-570](Dashboard.jsx#L558-L570))
  - Connection cards show photos
  - Added `photo` field to Supabase query
  - Falls back to initials if no photo

- ‚úÖ **Connections Page** (Multiple locations in [Connections.jsx](Connections.jsx))
  - Main connection card (lines 558-570)
  - Sidebar preview cards (lines 723-735)
  - Modal card (lines 887-899)
  - All display photos with initials fallback

**How it works:**
- Photos are fetched from `users.photo` field in Supabase
- If photo exists: displays photo
- If no photo: displays initials in circle with green text
- All photos have black borders and consistent styling

---

### 3. Swapped Events and Connections on Dashboard
**Status:** Complete ‚úì

**What changed:**
- **Before:** Events on left, Connections on right
- **After:** Connections on left, Events on right

**Updated file:** [Dashboard.jsx:434-591](Dashboard.jsx#L434-L591)

**Why:** This prioritizes showing connection recommendations first, which aligns with the app's core networking value proposition.
