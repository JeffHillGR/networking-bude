## Success Metrics to Calculate

### Connection Conversion Rate
```
Conversion Rate = (# who reached out to at least 1 person) / (# who received email)
Target: 30%+
```

### Average Match Quality Score
```
Match Quality = Average of Q8 responses
Target: 3.5+/5.0
```

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
```
Promoters (9-10): X%
Passives (7-8): X%
Detractors (0-6): X%

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
Target: +20 or higher (good), +50 or higher (excellent)
```

### Overall Satisfaction
```
Satisfaction = Average of Q13 responses
Target: 4.0+/5.0
```

### Connection Success Stories
- Count responses where outcome included meeting, business opportunity, or valuable conversation
- Target: 20%+ had a "success story"

## Follow-Up Actions Based on Results

### If Conversion Rate < 20%:
- Matches aren't relevant enough
- Need better matching algorithm
- Need more context in introduction emails
- Consider letting users approve matches first

### If Match Quality Score < 3.0:
- Revisit matching criteria
- Need more profile data from users
- May need to be more selective (fewer but better matches)

### If NPS < 0:
- Serious product-market fit issues
- Re-evaluate entire concept and approach
- Talk to detractors directly to understand problems

### If NPS 0-20:
- Product has potential but needs significant improvements
- Focus on fixing top pain points from Q15

### If NPS > 50:
- Strong product-market fit
- Ready to scale with confidence
- Focus on growth and automation
