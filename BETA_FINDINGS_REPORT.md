## Matching Algorithm Insights

### What Worked Well

**1. Organization-Based Matching (High Success Factor)**
- Organizations appearing multiple times were prioritized in compatibility scoring
- Created "warm, warm introductions" when people:
  - Both belonged to the same organization
  - One attended, one wanted to check it out
- **Method Used:** Simple Ctrl+F search to find organization mentions across profiles
- **Result:** Strong relevance in matches

**2. Strategic Partnership Targeting**
- Successfully gave particular attention to matches involving organizations we're looking to partner with
- Manual curation proved effective for beta scale
- **Insight:** This manual process validates what automated algorithm should prioritize

**3. Professional Interests Alignment**
- Fields like "Professional Interests" provided good matching signals when filled out
- Multiple shared interests = higher compatibility

### What Needs Improvement

**1. Insufficient Profile Data**
- **Issue:** Some matches were difficult because users didn't fill out key fields
- **Impact:** Harder to find meaningful connections
- **Examples:**
  - Missing "Networking Goals"
  - Empty "Professional Interests"
  - Incomplete company/job title information

**2. Algorithm Needs More Data Points**
- Need richer user profiles to draw matching insights from
- Current fields sometimes insufficient for confident matching

## Onboarding Flow Findings

### Critical Issues to Address

#### 1. Date of Birth (DOB) Field - LOW COMPLETION RATE

**Problem:**
- Users not filling out DOB field effectively
- Likely reasons:
  - Security/privacy concerns
  - Don't want "birthday cards"
  - Feels too personal for initial signup

**Recommended Solution:**
- **Change to "Year Born"** instead of full DOB
  - Less invasive
  - Still provides age-range matching capability
  - Reduces perceived security risk
  - Example: "1985" instead of "01/15/1985"

**Implementation:**
- Update form field from date picker to 4-digit year input
- Update copy: "Year Born (helps us match you with similar age ranges)"

---

#### 2. Required vs Optional Fields - TOO MANY OPTIONALS

**Problem:**
- Users skipping important fields that are critical for matching
- Missing data = weaker matches = lower user satisfaction

**Recommended Solution:**
Make these fields **REQUIRED**:
- ‚úÖ First Name (already required)
- ‚úÖ Last Name (already required)
- ‚úÖ Email (already required)
- ‚úÖ Job Title (make required)
- ‚úÖ Company (make required)
- ‚úÖ Industry (make required)
- ‚úÖ **Networking Goals** (make required) ‚Üê Critical for matching
- ‚úÖ **Professional Interests** (make required) ‚Üê Critical for matching

Keep these **OPTIONAL**:
- Organizations (can be blank)
- Personal Interests (nice-to-have)
- Professional Interests Other (supplementary)

**Implementation:**
- Add red asterisk (*) to required fields
- Add validation: "Please complete all required fields"
- Consider progressive disclosure: Show why field matters

---

#### 3. Need More Profile Information - RICHER DATA NEEDED

**Problem:**
- Need more data points to make confident, meaningful matches
- Current fields don't capture full networking context

**Recommended New Fields:**

##### A. "How Would You Classify Yourself as a Networker?" (Single Select - REQUIRED)

Options:
- üéØ **"See and Be Seen"** - I attend events to raise my profile
- üéì **"Recent College Grad Looking for Work"** - Career entry focused
- üíº **"New Business Owner Looking for Clients"** - Sales/growth focused
- üìö **"Seeking Education & Professional Development"** - Learning focused
- ü§ù **"Looking to Make Community Connections"** - Relationship building
- üèõÔ∏è **"Looking to Serve on a Board or Committee"** - Volunteer leadership
- üí° **"Looking for Meaningful Connections"** - Quality over quantity
- üöÄ **"Building My Professional Network"** - General networking
- üë• **"Looking for Mentorship Opportunities"** - Mentee or mentor
- üîó **"Strategic Partnership Development"** - B2B focused

**Why This Matters:**
- Helps match people with compatible networking styles
- Example: Don't match "see and be seen" with "meaningful connections only"
- Validates mutual goals before introduction

##### B. Additional Suggested Fields to Consider:

**Career Stage** (Optional)
- Student
- Early Career (0-5 years)
- Mid-Career (5-15 years)
- Senior Professional (15+ years)
- Executive/Leadership
- Retired/Semi-Retired

**What I Can Offer Others** (Optional text field)
- Example: "I can introduce people to marketing contacts" or "I mentor early-career professionals"
- Helps create value-exchange matches

**What I'm Looking For** (Optional text field)
- Example: "Looking for introductions to healthcare industry leaders"
- More specific than general "Networking Goals"

**Preferred Networking Style** (Optional multi-select)
- One-on-one coffee chats
- Small group events (5-10 people)
- Large networking events
- Virtual connections
- Industry conferences
- Community service opportunities

## User Profile Quality Analysis

### Fields with High Completion Rates:
- ‚úÖ First Name, Last Name, Email (100% - required)
- ‚úÖ Job Title (~85%)
- ‚úÖ Company (~80%)
- ‚úÖ Professional Interests (~75%)

### Fields with Low Completion Rates:
- ‚ùå Date of Birth (~30% - NEEDS REDESIGN)
- ‚ùå Networking Goals (~50% - SHOULD BE REQUIRED)
- ‚ùå Personal Interests (~60%)
- ‚ùå Organizations to Check Out (~40%)

### Data Quality Issues:
- Some test/junk entries (e.g., "j m", "ff ff", ";lkkj;lkj")
- Need email verification to prevent fake signups
- Need data validation on form submission

---

## Matching Process Insights

### Current Manual Process (Beta Scale):
1. Export user profiles from Google Sheets
2. Review all 14 profiles manually
3. Use Ctrl+F to find shared organizations
4. Identify complementary professional interests
5. Look for networking goal alignment
6. Create connections spreadsheet
7. Generate personalized emails

**Time Investment:** ~3-4 hours for 14 users (39 connections)

### Automation Needs for Production:

**Must Automate:**
- Organization matching (exact match + fuzzy match)
- Professional interest overlap scoring
- Industry compatibility
- Networking goal alignment
- Geographic proximity (if using zip codes)

**Keep Manual/Curated:**
- Strategic partnership prioritization
- Quality review of questionable matches
- Edge case handling

**Recommended Hybrid Approach:**
- Algorithm generates top 5-10 potential matches per user
- Admin reviews and selects final 2-4 connections
- Allows for quality control while scaling
