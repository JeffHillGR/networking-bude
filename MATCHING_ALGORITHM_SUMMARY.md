# BudE Matching Algorithm - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Tested with Real Beta Data

---

## Overview

Successfully built and tested a compatibility matching algorithm for BudE networking app. Tested with 27 real beta users, achieving **5.0% match rate** (19 matches out of 378 possible pairings) - perfectly hitting the "quality over quantity" target.

## Final Scoring Weights

| Category | Weight | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Networking Goals** | 25% | Meaningful connections (+18), Growth keywords (+12) |
| **Organizations** | 50% | Split: 25% complementary + 25% same-field |
| **Professional Interests** | 15% | Proportional to shared interests |
| **Industry** | 5% | Exact match or related industries |
| **Gender Preference** | 2.5% | Default honored unless 80%+ match |
| **Age Preference** | 2.5% | Default honored, flexible scoring |
| **Personal Interests** | 5% | Hobbies like pickleball, hiking, etc. |

**Threshold:** 70/100 minimum to show as potential match

---

## Key Algorithm Insights

### 1. Organizations are King üëë
**All top 5 matches scored 50/50 on Organizations**
- Complementary matches (I attend ‚Üí You want to check out) = powerful connections
- Same-field matches (both attend or both want to check out) = validation
- This validates the 50% weight decision

### 2. Vulnerability Wins üíö
Users who shared honest networking frustrations scored higher:
- "awkward, don't like going alone" (Jeff)
- "pay to play, not actually meeting new people" (Kristina)
- "can be shy in new spaces" (Tina)
- "meaningful connections" keyword = gold

### 3. Empty Profiles = No Matches
Users with minimal data (Michael, Jackson, Daryn) scored 9-15% with everyone.
**Solution:** Safety Net Rule provides 1-2 basic matches + profile improvement prompt.

---

## Exception Rules Implemented

### Exception #1: Gender Preference Override (80%+ Rule)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented, dormant in beta data

**How it works:**
- Default: Honor user's gender preference
- Override: If compatibility ‚â•80%, show match regardless of gender preference
- UI shows: "Exceptional Match - 80%+ Compatible" badge
- User decides: Can still accept or decline

**Beta Results:**
- Shelby (prefers women) and Russell (prefers men) had gender preferences
- Highest cross-gender scores: ~48% (well below 80%)
- Rule didn't trigger but is ready for when it does

**Future Consideration:** May lower to 75% or 70% based on user acceptance data

---

### Exception #2: Safety Net Rule (Network Expansion)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested successfully

**How it works:**
- **Trigger:** User scores <40% with all candidates in 100+ user pool
- **Action:** Show 1-2 matches based on single shared attribute
- **Priority:** Organizations (15pts) > Professional Interests (10pts) > Industry (5pts)
- **UI:** Separate "Expand Your Network" section
- **Includes:** Prompt to improve profile

**Beta Results:**
| User | Issue | Safety Net Match |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Michael Yoder | No goals, minimal orgs | ‚úÖ Marketing interest |
| Jackson Payer | "Beta test" goal | ‚úÖ Technology industry |
| Daryn Lawson | No interests, no orgs | ‚úÖ Professional dev industry |

## User Engagement Strategy

### Profile Completion Prompts

**When:** User has 0 matches after 48-72 hours

**Message:**
> "No Suggested Connections Yet? Add more to your profile to expand your network"

**Specific Prompts Based on Missing Data:**
- ‚ùå No networking goals ‚Üí "Share what you're looking for in networking"
- ‚ùå No organizations ‚Üí "Add organizations you attend or want to explore"
- ‚ùå Minimal professional interests ‚Üí "Add more professional interests"
- ‚ùå Empty personal interests ‚Üí "Share your hobbies to find common ground"

**Best Practices:**
- Show as banner in Connections tab
- Dismissible but reappear after 7 days
- Email follow-up after 7 days if no updates
- Track engagement metrics

## Success Metrics to Track

### Match Quality
- User acceptance rate of matches
- User decline rate by match score (70-74% vs 75-79% vs 80%+)
- Number of actual connections made per match suggestion
- User feedback ratings on match quality

### Profile Completion
- % of users with complete profiles
- Profile completion rate after "no matches" prompt
- Correlation between profile completeness and match count

### Exception Rules
- 80%+ gender override activation rate
- User acceptance of gender override matches
- Safety net match engagement rate
- Profile improvement after safety net prompt

### Overall Health
- Average matches per user (target: 1-3)
- % of users with 0 matches (minimize this)
- % of users with 5+ matches (quality control)
- Bi-weekly active connection rate

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Algorithm is Ready for Backend
The matching algorithm is client-side for testing but should be moved server-side (Supabase Edge Functions) to:
1. Keep algorithm secret/proprietary
2. Run efficiently on large user base (100+)
3. Track connection history
4. Prevent duplicate suggestions

### Supabase Integration Needed
- Store user profiles in `users` table
- Store matches in `connections` table (with status: pending/accepted/rejected)
- Store suggestion history in `connection_history` table
- Run matching algorithm as scheduled Edge Function (bi-weekly)

### Frontend Needs
- Display compatibility percentage on profile cards
- Highlight matching fields in lime green (#D0ED00)
- Show match reasons ("Both attend: GR Chamber")
- Badge for exceptional matches (80%+)
- Separate section for safety net matches
- Profile completion prompts for users with no matches

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Organizations > All** - The 50% weight is validated. People want to meet at events they attend or get introduced to orgs they're curious about.

2. **Vulnerability = Matching Gold** - Generic goals ("build my network") score low. Honest frustrations ("feel awkward", "don't like going alone") create meaningful matches.

3. **Empty Profiles Need Help** - Safety net + prompts prevent user abandonment while maintaining quality standards.

4. **5% is the Sweet Spot** - 19 matches out of 378 possible = quality over quantity without making anyone feel isolated.

5. **Gender Preferences are Rare** - Only 2/28 users had preferences, and they didn't limit good matches in beta.

6. **Testing with Real Data Matters** - Fake test users would never reveal issues like Daryn/Michael/Jackson's minimal profiles.

---

## Algorithm Philosophy

**"Quality over quantity, but nobody gets left behind"**

- Default threshold (70%) maintains high quality
- Exception rules (80% override, <40% safety net) provide escape valves
- Profile prompts encourage improvement rather than lowering standards
- Bi-weekly refresh keeps matches fresh without overwhelming users
- 5-10 matches per cycle = manageable, meaningful connections

## Contact & Review

**Algorithm Owner:** Jeff Hill (grjeff@gmail.com)
**Next Review:** January 26, 2026 (Quarterly)
**Version:** 1.0

**Questions to Address in Next Review:**
1. Are users accepting 80%+ gender override matches?
2. Are safety net matches leading to profile improvements?
3. Should we adjust the 70% threshold or category weights?
4. Are there new networking goal keywords to add?
5. How is the bi-weekly cadence working for users?

## Appendix: Example Match Breakdowns

### High Quality Match (79%)
**Kristina Colby ‚Üî David Henson**
- Networking Goals: 14/25 (both growth-oriented)
- Organizations: 50/50 ‚≠ê (complementary + same-field)
- Professional Interests: 5/15 (technology, consulting)
- Industry: 5/5 (both consulting)
- Gender: 2.5/2.5
- Age: 2.5/2.5
- Personal: 0/5

**Why they match:** Perfect org overlap (David attends what Kristina wants to check out), same industry, growth mindset.

---

### Low Quality Match (15%)
**Jackson Payer ‚Üî Rob Geer**
- Networking Goals: 5/25
- Organizations: 0/50
- Professional Interests: 0/15
- Industry: 5/5 (both technology)
- Gender: 2.5/2.5
- Age: 2.5/2.5
- Personal: 0/5

**Why they don't match:** Jackson's profile is almost empty. Only shared attribute is technology industry. **Safety Net activates** to give Jackson this match with prompt to improve profile.
